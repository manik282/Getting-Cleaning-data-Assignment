## Code workflow

The R code run_analysis.R does the following data processingsteps using the Samsung wearable data
  
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
* Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* From the data set, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output is the data file tidy_data.txt
